# leaflet-challenge

This directory contains the solutions for the leaflet challenge homework assignment. 

## Contents
There are two main directories included in this solution: **Leaflet-Step-1** and **Leaflet-Step-2**. Each contains the same sub-directories for mapping geodata:
### **Static/** 
### 1.  Static/js/: 
- **logic.js**: contains code and comments for creating maps, plotting earthquake data, and creating the legend or layer controls according to each assignment.
- **config.js**: this file is required to use the mapbox API. It must contain a variable API_KEY with the appropriate access key for maps to be created. NOTE: for security reasons, this file is not pushed to github.
### 2.  Static/css/:  
- **style.css**:  used for styling the maps and html elements.
